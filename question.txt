Question:
Suppose that you are given source code for a DBMS that does not support indexing. This code was extensively tested, so we have a high degree of confidence that it works correctly. Now you were asked to extend the code, such that the indexing is supported. How would you test your extended code to make sure it works properly with indexing? Note that you don't need to provide any additional code for this question, just the answer.

There are multiple ways that I can test my extended code:
- First, we run all the orginal function without create index to ensure that my extended code doesn't affect any function in the DBMS.
- Performance checking: I'll select a random variable to query with and without index to see if the result match, and check the time elapsed to see if the index works (it should takes less time than no index).
- I could test creating index in multiple columns or multiple data types in the DBMS.
- Test for errors: For example: drop index without create, uncorrect command, create index in non-existent column,...
